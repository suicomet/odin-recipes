            This air fryer French fries recipe includes a cold water-hot water soaking trick that produces super crispy French fries. Made with just four ingredients, these fries rival traditional fries but use a fraction of the oil. Serve with burgers, steak, or chicken with something to dip them in, like honey mustard, spicy ketchup, or garlic aioli.
